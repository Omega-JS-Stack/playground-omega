/**
 * The notes routes end to end over the real HTTP surface: GET, POST and DELETE

 * rewrite (src/routes/notes/), their schemas (src/schemas/notes/), and the
 * welcome note the on-create auth hook (src/hooks/auth/on-create.js) seeds.
 *
 * The suite writes notes, so it runs as the two personas test/_init.js declares
 * for it (`notes-owner`, `notes-other`) and never as a shared one.

 * Run (from this target): npx omega test routes/notes
