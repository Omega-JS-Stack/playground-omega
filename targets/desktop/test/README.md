# Project tests

Drop your project test suites here. The framework auto-runs them alongside its own when you run `npx omega test`.

## Layers

Match the framework's four layers — OMEGA Desktop's test runner discovers files by the directory they sit in:

| Directory | Runtime | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `test/build/` | Plain Node | Build-time logic, config validation, pure utilities |
| `test/main/` | Spawned Electron main process | IPC, storage, windows, anything that needs `app.*` |
| `test/renderer/` | Hidden BrowserWindow | Renderer-side logic, DOM, preload bridge (add `view: '<name>'` to load one of your `src/views/`) |
| `test/boot/` | Consumer's actual built bundle | End-to-end smoke tests (does the app boot, does main show a window, do IPC handlers register) |

A renderer suite that declares `view: '<name>'` runs against that view of YOUR app instead of the framework's harness page: the framework builds the app first, so the page carries your real preload, IPC handlers and config. It rides the boot lane, so `--layer=boot` (or the default `all`) runs it and `--layer=renderer` does not.

## Coverage

Every feature ships with tests at every layer it has a surface in — logic (`build`/`main`), UI (`renderer`), end-to-end (`boot`). Skip a layer only when the feature genuinely has no surface there; "the logic test covers it" does not excuse the UI test.

## Quick example

The real suites beside this file are the worked example: [`build/config.test.js`](build/config.test.js) asserts the identity this project's `config/omega.json5` resolves to, [`boot/app-boots.test.js`](boot/app-boots.test.js) boots the real built bundle and asserts what `src/main.js` and `src/integrations/` wire up, and [`renderer/main-view.test.js`](renderer/main-view.test.js) (`view: 'main'`) asserts what `src/views/main/` puts on screen.

```js
// test/build/my-feature.test.js
const Manager = require('@omega.js/desktop/build');

module.exports = {
  layer: 'build',
  description: 'the project config carries a brand id',
  run: (ctx) => {
    ctx.expect(Manager.getConfig().brand.id).toBeTruthy();
  },
};
```

That is the standalone form: one test per file. Every `run` receives `ctx`, whose `ctx.expect` is the Jest-compatible assertion library (there is nothing to require). The `suite`, `group` and array forms, and the `inspect` form the `boot` layer takes, are all in the reference below.
