// The playground's release lane, shared by both target deploy hooks
// (#900, the rework of #899): PRUNE the target's release family on the
// playground's releases repo down to the newest one, so a deploy leaves exactly
// two releases live.
//
// The VERSION comes from `omega bump` at the brand root (#869), never from this
// hook: the brand root package.json is the one version every target follows, and
// a deploy refuses a target that drifted from it. The per-target bump this lane
// used to do is gone with it.
//
// A fresh version is what makes the deploy publishable at all: the Firefox store
// refuses a version it already holds ("Version 0.0.1 already exists"), and a
// fresh one also never trips electron-publish's two-hour rule, which is what
// #899's delete-and-redeploy was working around.
//
// Playground-only by construction: the releases repo is hard-coded and the
// brand guard runs FIRST, so a copy into another brand fails loudly instead of
// deleting that brand's releases. #192 migrates the target hooks that call this
// into the universal hook system when the desktop runner is reworked.
